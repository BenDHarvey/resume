\maketitle
Currently living and working in Newcastle NSW, Australia, I am a developer with a love for all things technology. I specialize as a full-stack engineer and have experience in developing solutions for both frontend and backend. My passion for innovative software solutions is supported by regular professional learning opportunities, undertaken in my personal time, which demonstrate I have a strong drive to stay at the forefront of web-based technologies. I am pragmatic in my approach to solving solutions and pride myself on finding simple solutions that fit the business need.

Having worked extensively in teams of software developers I am comfortable communicating over a range of mediums including; face to face, video and voice conference and text based applications. During my career I have worked with a range of multiple cross -functional teams and find I have a natural aptitude when collaborating on everything from project design phases to technical architecture and implementation.

\subsubsection*{General}
\label{sec:org2479403}

Through my career I not only been involved with writing application but have enjoyed being involved with running applications. I have experience deploy, maintaing and monitoring application on a number of platform. Any deployment of code should start with a code first and Infrastructure as code approach, I have experience using the following IaaC (infrastructure as code) and configuration management tools:

\begin{itemize}
\item Terraform
\item Ansible
\item AWS cloud formation
\item Docker
\begin{itemize}
\item Writing docker files for both development environments and deployment to production
\item Docker-compose for orchestrating environments for development and testing
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{AWS Cloud infrastrucutre}
\label{sec:org1a45da8}

I have used AWS cloud services to deploy and run cloud native applications and have exemplary knowledge and understanding of the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Deploying applications using ECS
\item AWS Lamba and API gateway
\item RDS
\item DynamoDB
\item S3
\item Lamba and serverless applications
\item General AWS deployments and networking
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Continuouse integration and deployment}
\label{sec:org891703a}

In addition to deploying applications to public clouds such as AWS I have an effective understanding of continuous deployment and integration practices. During my career, I have used multiple systems to implement build pipelines and feel confident in implementing these methodologies in any system or framework. The key products which I have utilized include:

\begin{itemize}
\item Buildkite
\item Gitlab CI
\item Bambo
\item Octopus deploy
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Kubernetes}
\label{sec:org6d2a7ce}

\begin{itemize}
\item General kubernetes administration and application deployment
\item Helm
\item ArgoCD
\end{itemize}
